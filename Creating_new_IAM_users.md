## Managing AWS Cloud Account

### Creating new IAM users
- It is required by BNL that IAM users be created for each account so that the root user is not frequently used
- Typically you will make an IAM user for each member of a lab group using the AWS account

### To create new IAM users
- Sign into AWS and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ "https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/")
- In the navigation pane, choose **Users** then choose **Add users**
- Type the user name for the new user. THIS WILL BE THE SIGN-IN name for AWS. 
- A maximum of 10 users can be added at one time
- Under Select AWS credential type:
	- check both boxes for **Access key** & **Password- AWS Management Console Access**
	- Ensure that the **Autogenerated password** box is checked
	- Ensure that the **Require password reset** box is checked
- Press the **Next:Permissions** button
- I have already 2 primary groups for users:
	- 1) Administrators- full administrator access for all cloud management (Need to minimize the number of users with full admin acccess)
	- 2) EC2_user- gives full permissions for creating and removing compute cloud instances (This the best permission setting for a regular user who may need to create or remove an instance)
- You need to select one of the permission groups already created or press the **Create group** button to create a new permissions group
- Press the **Next:tags** button
- You shouldn't have to add any tags
- Press the **Next:Review** button
- Review the user information and make sure that everything looks correct
- When ready, press the **Create user** button
- You will now see a summary page with all of the user information
- I recommend that you press the send email button and send the login information to each user that you have created
- MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE CSV!! This will include all of the initial login information for all of the users you have just created
- Send a second email to each user INDIVIDUALLY with the csv file including their login password
- Use the link at the top of this page to manage existing users
